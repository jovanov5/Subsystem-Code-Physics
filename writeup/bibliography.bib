abstract = {{Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5. Experiments on a noisy 127-qubit superconducting quantum processor report the accurate measurement of expectation values beyond the reach of current brute-force classical computation, demonstrating evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance.}},

The statistics of these surface anyons is explicitly computed and shown to be identical to the three-fermion Z2 model, a variant of Z2 topological order which cannot be realized in a purely D=2 system with time-reversal symmetry. Thus the model realizes a novel surface termination for three-dimensional (3D) SPT phases, that of a fully symmetric gapped surface with topological order. The 3D phase found here was previously proposed from a field theoretic analysis but is outside the group cohomology classification that appears to capture all SPT phases in lower dimensions. Such phases may potentially be realized in spin-orbit-coupled magnetic insulators, which evade magnetic ordering. Our construction utilizes the Walker-Wang prescription to create a 3D confined phase with surface anyons, which can be extended to other topological phases.}},

abstract = {{We consider quantum circuits consisting of randomly chosen two-local gates and study the number of gates needed for the distribution over measurement outcomes for typical circuit instances to be anti-concentrated, roughly meaning that the probability mass is not too concentrated on a small number of measurement outcomes. Understanding the conditions for anti-concentration is important for determining which quantum circuits are difficult to simulate classically, as anti-concentration has been in some cases an ingredient of mathematical arguments that simulation is hard and in other cases a necessary condition for easy simulation. Our definition of anti-concentration is that the expected collision probability, that is, the probability that two independently drawn outcomes will agree, is only a constant factor larger than if the distribution were uniform. We show that when the 2-local gates are each drawn from the Haar measure (or any two-design), at least \$\textbackslashOmega(n \textbackslashlog(n))\$ gates (and thus \$\textbackslashOmega(\textbackslashlog(n))\$ circuit depth) are needed for this condition to be met on an \$n\$ qudit circuit. In both the case where the gates are nearest-neighbor on a 1D ring and the case where gates are long-range, we show \$O(n \textbackslashlog(n))\$ gates are also sufficient, and we precisely compute the optimal constant prefactor for the \$n \textbackslashlog(n)\$. The technique we employ relies upon a mapping from the expected collision probability to the partition function of an Ising-like classical statistical mechanical model, which we manage to bound using stochastic and combinatorial techniques.}},

These MPOs describe the possibly anomalous symmetry of the edge theory, whose local degrees of freedom are concretely identified in a PEPS. A classification of SPT phases is obtained by studying the obstructions to continuously deforming one set of MPOs into another, recovering the results derived for fixed-point models [Chen et al., Phys.

Our formalism accommodates perturbations away from fixed-point models, opening the possibility of studying phase transitions between different SPT phases. We also demonstrate that applying the recently developed quantum state gauging procedure to a SPT PEPS yields a PEPS with topological order determined by the initial symmetry MPOs. The MPO framework thus unifies the different approaches to classifying SPT phases, via fixed-point models, boundary anomalies, or gauging the symmetry, into the single problem of classifying inequivalent sets of matrix product operator symmetries that are defined purely in terms of a PEPS.}},

In particular, in driven systems in two dimensions (2D), robust chiral edge states can appear even though the Chern numbers of all the bulk Floquet bands are zero. Here we elucidate the crucial distinctions between static and driven 2D systems, and construct a new topological invariant that yields the correct edge state structure in the driven case.

We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the “entanglement tsunami” in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like (time)1/3 and are spatially correlated over a distance ∝(time)2/3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a “minimal cut” picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the “velocity” of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.}},

abstract = {{This paper addresses some general questions of quantum information theory arising from the transmission of quantum entanglement through (possibly noisy) quantum channels. A pure entangled state is prepared of a pair of systems \$R\$ and \$Q\$, after which \$Q\$ is subjected to a dynamical evolution given by the superoperator \$\textbackslashsuperop\textasciicircum\{Q\}\$. Two interesting quantities can be defined for this process: the entanglement fidelity \$F\_\{e\}\$ and the entropy production \$S\_\{e\}\$. It turns out that neither of these quantities depends in any way on the system \$R\$, but only on the initial state and dynamical evolution of \$Q\$. \$F\_\{e\}\$ and \$S\_\{e\}\$ are related to various other fidelities and entropies, and are connected by an inequality reminiscent of the Fano inequality of classical information theory. Some insight can be gained from these techniques into the security of quantum cryptographic protocols and the nature of quantum error-correcting codes.}},

Our primary example is a Pauli stabilizer model on four-dimensional qudits that belongs to the double semion (DS) phase of matter. The DS stabilizer Hamiltonian is constructed by condensing an emergent boson in a Z4 toric code, where the condensation is implemented at the level of the ground states by two-body measurements. We rigorously verify the topological order of the DS stabilizer model by identifying an explicit finite-depth quantum circuit (with ancillary qubits) that maps its ground-state subspace to that of a DS string-net model. We show that the construction of the DS stabilizer Hamiltonian generalizes to all twisted quantum doubles (TQDs) with Abelian anyons. This yields a Pauli stabilizer code on composite-dimensional qudits for each such TQD, implying that the classification of topological Pauli stabilizer codes extends well beyond stacks of toric codes—in fact, exhausting all Abelian anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary. We also demonstrate that symmetry-protected topological phases of matter characterized by type-I and type-II cocycles can be modeled by Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians by gauging certain 1-form symmetries of the TQD stabilizer models.}},

The difference between the TEE and the value predicted by the anyon theory is often called the “spurious” topological entanglement entropy.

When one type of bond is dominantly measured, we find area-law entangled phases that protect two topological qubits (on a torus) for a time exponential in system size. This generalizes the recently proposed idea of Floquet codes, where logical qubits are dynamically generated by a time-periodic measurement schedule, to a stochastic setting. When all types of bonds are measured with comparable frequency, we find a critical phase with a logarithmic violation of the area law, which sharply distinguishes it from its Hamiltonian counterpart. The critical phase has the same set of topological qubits, as diagnosed by the tripartite mutual information, but protects them only for a time polynomial in system size. Furthermore, we observe an unusual behavior for the dynamical purification of mixed states, characterized at late times by the dynamical exponent z=12, a superballistic dynamics made possible by measurements.}},

The lattice is formed by a sequence of coupled transmission line resonators, each of which is connected to a transmon qubit. Synthetic spin-orbit coupling and effective Zeeman field of the polariton can both be tuned by modulating the coupling strength between neighbouring resonators, allowing for the realization of a large variety of polaritonic topological semimetal bands. Methods for detecting the polaritonic topological edge states and topological invariants are also proposed.

Recently it has been suggested that higher-spin, especially spin-1, Kitaev exchange interactions can be realized in a variety of materials. Numerical computations on small clusters indicate that the ground state of the spin-1 Kitaev model may also be a quantum spin liquid. On the other hand, the nature of the ground state remains elusive since the spin-1 model is not exactly solvable in contrast to the spin-1/2 model. In this work, using the quantum-entanglement based tensor network approach, we construct an explicit ground-state wave function for the spin-1 Kitaev model, which is written only in terms of physical spin operators. We establish the existence of distinct topological sectors on a torus by constructing the minimally entangled states in the degenerate ground-state manifold and evaluating topological entanglement entropy. Our results suggest that the ground state of the spin-1 Kitaev model is a gapped quantum spin liquid with Z2 gauge structure and Abelian quasiparticles.

An example of such an “entanglement phase transition” is provided by the many-body localization transition in disordered quantum systems, as it separates highly entangled thermal states at weak disorder from many-body localized states with low entanglement at strong disorder. In the spirit of random matrix theory, we describe a simple model for such transitions where a physical quantum many-body system lives at the “holographic” boundary of a bulk random tensor network. Using a replica trick approach, we map the calculation of the entanglement properties of the boundary system onto the free energy cost of fluctuating domain walls in a classical statistical mechanics model. This allows us to interpret transitions between volume-law and area-law scaling of entanglement as ordering transitions in this statistical mechanics model. Our approach allows us to get an analytic handle on the field theory of these entanglement transitions.}},

We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics, representing either Hamiltonian evolution with time-dependent noise or evolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure behind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for the “entanglement tsunami” in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show that noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement grows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like (time)1/3 and are spatially correlated over a distance ∝(time)2/3. We derive KPZ universal behavior in three complementary ways, by mapping random entanglement growth to (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface, (ii) a “minimal cut” picture, reminiscent of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in holography, and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading of operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using simulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading-order time dependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise, allowing us to propose a simple coarse grained minimal cut picture for the entanglement growth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary dimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the “velocity” of entanglement growth in the 1D entanglement tsunami. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy entanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a membrane or domain wall by disorder.}},

We associate antihermitian forms of unit determinant over Laurent polynomial rings to TI Clifford QCA with lattice boundaries, and prove that the form determines the QCA up to Clifford circuits and shifts (trivial). It follows that every 2D TI Clifford QCA is trivial since the antihermitian form in this case is always trivial. Further, we prove that for any \$D\$ the fourth power of any TI Clifford QCA is trivial. We present explicit examples of nontrivial TI Clifford QCA for \$D=3\$ and any odd prime \$p\$, and show that the Witt group of the finite field \$\textbackslashmathbb F\_p\$ is a subgroup of the group \$\textbackslashmathfrak C(D = 3, p)\$ of all TI Clifford QCA modulo trivial ones.

In an appendix independent of the main body of the paper, we revisit a recent theorem of Freedman and Hastings that any two-dimensional QCA, which is not necessarily Clifford or translation invariant, is a constant depth quantum circuit followed by a shift.

We also prove that the one-dimensional family of stochastic Gibbs states for the symmetric six vertex model converge under the same scaling to the stationary solution to the stochastic Burgers equation. Our proofs rely upon the Markov (self) duality of our model. The starting point is an exact microscopic Hopf-Cole transform for the stochastic six vertex model which follows from the model's known one-particle Markov self-duality. Given this transform, the crucial step is to establish self-averaging for specific quadratic function of the transformed height function. We use the model's two-particle self-duality to produce explicit expressions (as Bethe ansatz contour integrals) for conditional expectations from which we extract time-decorrelation and hence self-averaging in time. The crux of our Markov duality method is that the entire convergence result reduces to precise estimates on the one-particle and two-particle transition probabilities. Previous to our work, Markov dualities had only been used to prove convergence of particle systems to linear Gaussian SPDEs (e.g. the stochastic heat equation with additive noise).}},

These include a charge-fuzzy phase in which charge information is rapidly scrambled leading to slowly decaying spatial fluctuations of charge in the steady state, and a charge-sharp phase in which measurements collapse quantum fluctuations of charge without destroying the volume-law entanglement of neutral degrees of freedom. By taking a continuous-time, weak-measurement limit, we construct a controlled replica field theory description of these phases and their intervening charge-sharpening transition in one spatial dimension. We find that the charge fuzzy phase is a critical phase with continuously evolving critical exponents that terminates in a modified Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the short-range correlated charge-sharp phase.

abstract = {{Random quantum circuits yield minimally structured models for chaotic quantum dynamics, which are able to capture, for example, universal properties of entanglement growth. We provide exact results and coarse-grained models for the spreading of operators by quantum circuits made of Haar-random unitaries. We study both 1+1D and higher dimensions and argue that the coarse-grained pictures carry over to operator spreading in generic many-body systems. In 1+1D, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation, which gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC and determines the butterfly speed vB. We find that in 1+1D, the “front” of the OTOC broadens diffusively, with a width scaling in time as t1/2. We address fluctuations in the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that they are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front within a realization. Turning to higher dimensions, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a remarkable correspondence with a purely classical droplet growth problem. This implies that the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as t1/3 in 2+1D and as t0.240 in 3+1D (exponents of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class). We support our analytic argument with simulations in 2+1D. We point out that, in two or higher spatial dimensions, the shape of the spreading operator at late times is affected by underlying lattice symmetries and, in general, is not spherical. However, when full spatial rotational symmetry is present in 2+1D, our mapping implies an exact asymptotic form for the OTOC, in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. For an alternative perspective on the OTOC in 1+1D, we map it to the partition function of an Ising-like statistical mechanics model. As a result of special structure arising from unitarity, this partition function reduces to a random walk calculation which can be performed exactly. We also use this mapping to give exact results for entanglement growth in 1+1D circuits.}},

We show that if this QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth, then there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian which realizes the three-fermion topological order which is widely believed not to be possible. We conjecture in accordance with this belief that this QCA is not a quantum circuit of constant depth, and we provide two further pieces of evidence to support the conjecture. We show that this QCA maps every local Pauli operator to a local Pauli operator, but is not a Clifford circuit of constant depth. Further, we show that if the three-dimensional QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth, then there exists a two-dimensional QCA acting on fermionic degrees of freedom which cannot be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth; i.e., we prove the existence of a nontrivial QCA in either three or two dimensions. The square of our three-dimensional QCA can be realized by a quantum circuit of constant depth, and this suggests the existence of a Z2 invariant of a QCA in higher dimensions, totally distinct from the classification by positive rationals (i.e., by one integer index for each prime) in one dimension. In an “Appendix”, unrelated to the main body of this paper, we give a fermionic generalization of a result of Bravyi and Vyalyi (Quantum Inf Comput 5:187–215, 2005. arXiv:quant-ph/0308021) on ground states of 2-local commuting Hamiltonians.}},

In a chain of 46 superconducting qubits, we studied the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred across the chain’s center, PM. The first two moments of PM show superdiffusive behavior, a hallmark of KPZ universality. However, the third and fourth moments ruled out the KPZ conjecture and allow for evaluating other theories.

Various generalizations of Rényi entropies to the quantum setting have been proposed, most prominently Petz's quasi-entropies and Renner's conditional min-, max-, and collision entropy. However, these quantum extensions are incompatible and thus unsatisfactory. We propose a new quantum generalization of the family of Rényi entropies that contains the von Neumann entropy, min-entropy, collision entropy, and the max-entropy as special cases, thus encompassing most quantum entropies in use today. We show several natural properties for this definition, including data-processing inequalities, a duality relation, and an entropic uncertainty relation.}},

A potential obstruction to such a mechanism could arise if there exists a symmetry between anyons that have non-trivial mutual statistics. Here we consider toric code subjected to errors that tend to proliferate anyons with non-trivial mutual statistics. Using triangle inequality, we show that in the presence of electromagnetic duality and a partial-transpose symmetry, a decoherence induced phase transition out of the topological phase must be rather unconventional and lie beyond standard rules of anyon condensation. To explore such physics, we first subject toric code to a self-dual quantum channel where Kraus operators are proportional to X+Z. We find that the topological phase is stable up to the maximal error rate, when viewing density matrix as a pure state in the double Hilbert space. To access an unconventional transition, we then consider a perturbed toric code subjected to the self-dual channel, and find numerical evidence that beyond a critical error rate, the topological phase is destroyed resulting in a critical phase where anyons are only power-law condensed.}},

Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. We present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as matrix product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor network methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth region of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond dimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by showing that, if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the associated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use the method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with 201 sites. On the basis of these data and previous results, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the OTOC near the wavefront. We show that this form collapses the chaotic spin chain data over more than 15 orders of magnitude. A general method is proposed to calculate the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) in one-dimensional systems. Motivated by the results obtained from its application to various systems, a universal form for the dynamics of OTOCs is conjectured.}},

abstract = {{The classification and characterization of topological phases of matter is well understood for ground states of gapped Hamiltonians that are well isolated from the environment. However, decoherence due to interactions with the environment is inevitable -- thus motivating the investigation of topological orders in the context of mixed states. Here, we take a step toward classifying mixed-state topological orders in two spatial dimensions by considering their (emergent) generalized symmetries. We argue that their 1-form symmetries and the associated anyon theories lead to a partial classification under two-way connectivity by quasi-local quantum channels. This allows us to establish mixed-state topological orders that are intrinsically mixed, i.e., that have no ground state counterpart. We provide a wide range of examples based on topological subsystem codes, decohering \$G\$-graded string-net models, and "classically gauging" symmetry-enriched topological orders. One of our main examples is an Ising string-net model under the influence of dephasing noise. We study the resulting space of locally-indistinguishable states and compute the modular transformations within a particular coherent space. Based on our examples, we identify two possible effects of quasi-local quantum channels on anyon theories: (1) anyons can be incoherently proliferated -- thus reducing to a commutant of the proliferated anyons, or (2) the system can be "classically gauged", resulting in the symmetrization of anyons and an extension by transparent bosons. Given these two mechanisms, we conjecture that mixed-state topological orders are classified by premodular anyon theories, i.e., those for which the braiding relations may be degenerate.}},

The applicability of such methods to the dynamics of many-body systems is less clear: The memory required grows exponentially in time in most cases, quickly becoming unmanageable. New methods reduce the memory required by selectively discarding/dissipating parts of the many-body wave function which are expected to have little effect on the hydrodynamic observables typically of interest: For example, some methods discard fine-grained correlations associated with n-point functions, with n exceeding some cutoff ℓ*. In this paper, we present a theory for the sizes of backflow corrections, i.e., systematic errors due to discarding this fine-grained information. In particular, we focus on their effect on transport coefficients. Our results suggest that backflow corrections are exponentially suppressed in the size of the cutoff ℓ*. Moreover, the backflow errors themselves have a hydrodynamical expansion, which we elucidate. We test our predictions against numerical simulations run on random unitary circuits and ergodic spin chains. These results lead to the conjecture that transport coefficients in ergodic diffusive systems can be captured to a given precision ε with an amount of memory scaling as exp[O(log(ε)2)], significantly better than the naive estimate of memory exp[O(poly(ε−1))] required by more brute-force methods.}},

abstract = {{We map the dynamics of entanglement in random unitary circuits, with finite onsite Hilbert space dimension q, to an effective classical statistical mechanics, and develop general diagrammatic tools for calculations in random unitary circuits. We demonstrate explicitly the emergence of a “minimal membrane” governing entanglement growth, which in 1+1 dimensions is a directed random walk in spacetime (or a variant thereof). Using the replica trick to handle the logarithm in the definition of the nth Rényi entropy, Sn, we map the calculation of the entanglement after a quench to a problem of interacting random walks. A key role is played by effective classical spins (taking values in a permutation group) which distinguish between different ways of pairing spacetime histories in the replicated system. For the second Rényi entropy, S2, we are able to take the replica limit explicitly. This gives a mapping between entanglement growth and a directed polymer in a random medium at finite temperature (confirming Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling for entanglement growth in generic noisy systems). We find that the entanglement growth rate (“speed”) vn depends on the Rényi index n, and we calculate v2 and v3 in an expansion in the inverse local Hilbert space dimension, 1/q. These rates are determined by the free energy of a random walk and of a bound state of two random walks, respectively, and include contributions of “energetic” and “entropic” origin. We give a combinatorial interpretation of the Page-like subleading corrections to the entanglement at late times and discuss the dynamics of the entanglement close to and after saturation. We briefly discuss the application of these insights to time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics.}},

Recent advances have uncovered an intrinsically many-body generalization of quantum teleportation, with an elegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular, the teleportation of quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from strongly interacting systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the gravitational perspective, such quantum teleportation can be understood as the transmission of information through a traversable wormhole. Here, we propose and analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation—dubbed peaked-size teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes precisely the same type of quantum circuit as traversable wormhole teleportation yet has a completely distinct microscopic origin: It relies upon the spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and not gravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size teleportation, both analytically and numerically, across a diverse landscape of physical systems, including random unitary circuits, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains, and a bulk theory of gravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way toward using many-body quantum teleportation as a powerful experimental tool for (i) characterizing the size distributions of operators in strongly correlated systems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational scrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint for realizing many-body quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg atom arrays; effects of decoherence and experimental imperfections are analyzed.}},

Recently, all states within so-called SPTO cluster phases on the square and hexagonal lattices have been shown to be universal, based on the presence of subsystem symmetries and associated structures of quantum cellular automata. Motivated by this observation, we analyze the computational capability of SPTO cluster phases on all vertex-translative 2D Archimedean lattices. There are four subsystem symmetries here called ribbon, cone, fractal, and 1-form symmetries, and the former three are fundamentally in one-to-one correspondence with three classes of Clifford quantum cellular automata. We conclude that nine out of the eleven Archimedean lattices support universal cluster phases protected by one of the former three symmetries, while the remaining lattices possess 1-form symmetries and have a different capability related to error correction.}},

These phenomena are difficult to observe in conventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of measurement from dephasing, it is necessary to post-select on sets of measurement outcomes whose Born probabilities are exponentially small in the number of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this exponential `post-selection problem', is to construct cross-correlations between experimental data and the results of simulations on classical computers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite relation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate shadow tomography into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of quantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify cross-correlations which both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged von Neumann entanglement entropy, and additional cross-correlations which lower bound the measurement-averaged purity and entanglement negativity. These bounds show that experiments can be performed to constrain post-measurement entanglement without the need for post-selection. To illustrate our technique we consider how it could be used to observe the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum circuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum simulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory, we construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension. Our results reveal a signature of measurement-induced criticality that can be observed using a quantum simulator in polynomial time and with polynomial classical memory.}},

State merging enabled one to solve a number of open problems: distributed quantum data compression, quantum coding with side information at the decoder and sender, multi-party entanglement of assistance, and the capacity of the quantum multiple access channel.

abstract = {{While many-body systems can host long-ranged entangled quantum spin liquids (QSLs), the ingredients for realizing these as ground states can be prohibitively difficult. In many circumstances, one requires (i) a constrained Hilbert space and (ii) an extensive quantum superposition. The paradigmatic example is the toric code, or \$\textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ spin liquid, which is a superposition of closed loop states. We show how non-equilibrium Hamiltonian dynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating such QSLs. Rather than cooling into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, we show how a simple parameter sweep can dynamically project a family of initial product states into the constrained space, giving rise to a QSL. For the toric code, this is achieved in systems with a separation in energy scales between the \$e\$- and \$m\$-anyons, where one can sweep in a way that is adiabatic (sudden) with respect to the former (latter). Although this separation of scales does not extend to the thermodynamic limit, we analytically and numerically show that this method efficiently prepares a spin liquid in finite-sized regions, which we brand ``quantum spin lakes.'' This mechanism elucidates recent experimental and numerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice spin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. In fact, the slow dynamics of \$m\$-anyons suggest that we can capture spin lake preparation by simulating the dynamics on tree lattices, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. Finally, we use this mechanism to propose new experiments, e.g., for preparing a finite-sized \$U(1)\$ spin liquid as a honeycomb Rokhsar-Kivelson dimer model using Rydberg atoms -- which is remarkable given its equilibrium counterpart is unstable in \$2 + 1\$D. Our work opens up a new avenue in the study of non-equilibrium physics, as well as the exploration of exotic states of finite extent in NISQ devices.}},

Phys. 321, 2 (2006)0003-491610.1016/j.aop.2005.10.005], we study quantum circuit dynamics in 2+1 dimensions involving local projective measurements, in which the monitored trajectories realize (i) a phase with topological quantum order or (ii) a “critical” phase with a logarithmic violation of area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy along with long-range tripartite entanglement. A Majorana parton description of these dynamics, which provides an out-of-equilibrium generalization of the parton description of the Kitaev honeycomb model, permits an analytic understanding of the universal properties of these two phases, including the entanglement properties of the steady state, the dynamics of the system on the approach to equilibrium, and the phase transition between these states. In the topologically ordered phase, two logical qubits can be encoded in an initial state and protected for a time which scales exponentially in the linear dimension of the system, while no robust encoding of quantum information persists in the critical phase. Extensive numerical simulations of these monitored dynamics confirm our analytic predictions.}},

By combining this construction with the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), we can show that an injective PEPS for the matter fields is gauged into a G-injective PEPS for the combined gauge-matter system, which potentially has topological order. We derive the corresponding parent Hamiltonian, which is a frustration-free gauge-theory Hamiltonian closely related to the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian at zero coupling constant. We can then introduce gauge dynamics at finite values of the coupling constant by applying a local filtering operation.

Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.}},

In this way, lattice gauge theories provide both motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research towards the development of special purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and ultimately of scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent results and new tools from a quantum science approach to study lattice gauge theories are reviewed. Two new complementary approaches are discussed: first, tensor network methods are presented – a classical simulation approach – applied to the study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, recent proposals for the implementation of lattice gauge theory quantum simulators in different quantum hardware are reported, e.g., trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits. Finally, the first proof-of-principle trapped ions experimental quantum simulations of the Schwinger model are reviewed.}},

We also demonstrate that applying the recently developed quantum state gauging procedure to a SPT PEPS yields a PEPS with topological order determined by the initial symmetry MPOs.

abstract = {{Recent progress in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [J. Preskill, Quantum 2, 79 (2018)] represents an exciting opportunity for many-body physics by introducing new laboratory platforms with unprecedented control and measurement capabilities. We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body physics in a practical sense: we ask which physical phenomena, in the domain of quantum statistical mechanics, they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. While a universal quantum computer can simulate any system, the eponymous noise inherent to NISQ devices practically favors certain simulation tasks over others in the near term. As a particularly well-suited target, we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel nonequilibrium states of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder-induced many-body localization. While promising precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms—ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen-vacancy centers to NMR crystals—none have all the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully fledged incarnation of this phase, and for detecting its signature long-range spatiotemporal order. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties, a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization, and readout. Specifically, the architecture of Google’s Sycamore processor is a remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence, and how they can be distinguished from ‘internal’ decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances.}},

One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν=0 and ν=±1, respectively.

Generating these phases in an engineered system could provide deeper insight into their nature and the potential for harnessing their unique properties. However, concurrently bringing together the main ingredients for realizing many-body phenomena in a single experimental platform is a major challenge. Using superconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and strong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for studying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phenomena. The artificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit couplings. In a closed loop formed by the three qubits, we observe the directional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions via the creation of photon-vacancies, or "holes", which circulate in the opposite direction. The combination of these key elements results in chiral groundstate currents, the first direct measurement of persistent currents in low-lying eigenstates of strongly interacting bosons. The observation of chiral currents at such a small scale is interesting and suggests that the rich many-body physics could survive to smaller scales. We also motivate the feasibility of creating FQH states with near future superconducting technologies. Our work introduces an experimental platform for engineering quantum phases of strongly interacting photons and highlight a path toward realization of bosonic FQH states.}},

Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no \$\textbackslashtextit\{thermodynamic\}\$ phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit \$\textbackslashtextit\{ergodicity-breaking\}\$ dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit.

In their most general form, these symmetries are represented by matrix product operators acting on the virtual level, which leads to a set of algebraic rules characterizing states with topological quantum order. This construction generalizes the concepts of G- and twisted injectivity; the corresponding matrix product operators encode all topological features of the theory and provide a complete picture of the ground state manifold on the torus. We show how the string-net models of Levin and Wen fit within this formalism and in doing so provide a particularly intuitive interpretation of the pentagon equation for F-symbols as the pulling of matrix product operators through the string-net tensor network.

abstract = {{Quantum process tomography is a critical capability for building quantum computers, enabling quantum networks, and understanding quantum sensors. Like quantum state tomography, the process tomography of an arbitrary quantum channel requires a number of measurements that scales exponentially in the number of quantum bits affected. However, the recent field of shadow tomography, applied to quantum states, has demonstrated the ability to extract key information about a state with only polynomially many measurements. In this work, we apply the concepts of shadow state tomography to the challenge of characterizing quantum processes. We make use of the Choi isomorphism to directly apply rigorous bounds from shadow state tomography to shadow process tomography, and we find additional bounds on the number of measurements that are unique to process tomography. Our results, which include algorithms for implementing shadow process tomography, enable new techniques including evaluation of channel concatenation and the application of channels to shadows of quantum states. This provides a dramatic improvement for understanding large-scale quantum systems.}},

Our work both extends the classification of two-dimensional Pauli topological subsystem codes to systems of composite-dimensional qudits and establishes that the classification is at least as rich as that of Abelian anyon theories. We exemplify the construction with topological subsystem codes defined on four-dimensional qudits based on the \$\textbackslashmathbb\{Z\}\_4\textasciicircum\{(1)\}\$ anyon theory with degenerate braiding relations and the chiral semion theory–both of which cannot be captured by topological stabilizer codes. The construction proceeds by "gauging out" certain anyon types of a topological stabilizer code. This amounts to defining a gauge group generated by the stabilizer group of the topological stabilizer code and a set of anyonic string operators for the anyon types that are gauged out. The resulting topological subsystem code is characterized by an anyon theory containing a proper subset of the anyons of the topological stabilizer code. We thereby show that every Abelian anyon theory is a subtheory of a stack of toric codes and a certain family of twisted quantum doubles that generalize the double semion anyon theory. We further prove a number of general statements about the logical operators of translation invariant topological subsystem codes and define their associated anyon theories in terms of higher-form symmetries.}},

Recent work has shown that interleaving the unitary operations with single-qubit measurements can drive a transition between high- and low-entanglement phases. Here we study a class of symmetric random quantum circuits with two competing types of measurement in addition to unitary dynamics. We find a rich phase diagram involving robust symmetry-protected topological, trivial and volume law entangled phases, where the transitions are hidden to expectation values of any operator and are only apparent by averaging the entanglement entropy over quantum trajectories. In the absence of unitary dynamics, we find a purely measurement-induced critical point, which maps exactly to two copies of a classical two-dimensional percolation problem. Numerical simulations indicate that this transition is a tricritical point that splits into two critical lines in the presence of arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics with an intervening volume law entangled phase. Our results show that measurements alone are sufficient to induce criticality and logarithmic entanglement scaling, and arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics can be sufficient to stabilize volume law entangled phases in the presence of rapid, yet competing, measurements. Repeatedly measuring an array of qubits can create topologically distinct phases depending on which measurements are applied. Lavasani et al. show that critical behaviour can arise from the competition between different choices of measurements.}},

In their most general form, these symmetries are represented by matrix product operators acting on the virtual level, which leads to a set of algebraic rules characterizing states with topological quantum order. This construction generalizes the concepts of G- and twisted injectivity; the corresponding matrix product operators encode all topological features of the theory and provide a complete picture of the ground state manifold on the torus. We show how the string-net models of Levin and Wen fit within this formalism and in doing so provide a particularly intuitive interpretation of the pentagon equation for F-symbols as the pulling of matrix product operators through the string-net tensor network. Our approach paves the way to finding novel topological phases beyond string nets and elucidates the description of topological phases in terms of entanglement Hamiltonians and edge theories.}},

However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed.

Our focus is on Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid ground states, a continuous family of critical states in one dimension whose structure is characterized by a Luttinger parameter K. We show that arbitrarily weak local measurements, performed over extended regions of space, can conspire to drive transitions in long-distance correlations. Conditioning first on a translation-invariant set of measurement outcomes, we show that there is a transition in the character of the postmeasurement quantum state for K<1, and highlight a formal analogy with the effect of a static defect on transport through a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. To investigate the full ensemble of measurement outcomes, we consider averages of physical quantities which are necessarily nonlinear in the system density matrix. We show how their behavior can be understood within a replica field theory, and for the measurements that we consider we find that the symmetry of the theory under exchange of replicas is broken for K<1/2. A well-known barrier to experimentally observing the collective effects of multiple measurements has been the need to postselect on random outcomes. Here we resolve this problem by introducing cross-correlations between experimental measurement results and classical simulations, which act as resource-efficient probes of the transition.

They have been used to construct explicit toy models realizing many of the interesting structural features of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models naturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT correspondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that the entanglement entropy of all boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties of the multipartite entanglement of assistance. We also discuss the behavior of Rényi entropies in our models and contrast it with AdS/CFT. Moreover, we find that each boundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement wedge, i.e., the bulk region enclosed by the boundary region and the minimal surface. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the partition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the bulk minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface behavior topologically, in a way similar to the effect of creating a black hole. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest. While we are primarily motivated by the AdS/CFT duality, the main results of the article define a more general form of bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to other spacetimes.}},

We also explain why Itopo is more suitable for our purposes than the more familiar entanglement entropy Stopo. A scaling law, encoding the interplay of volume and temperature effects, as well as different limit procedures, are derived in detail. A non-Abelian model is next analyzed and similar results are found. Finally, we also consider, in the case of a one-plaquette toric code, an environment model giving rise to a simulation of thermal effects in time.}},

abstract = {{We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.}},

Recently, it has come to light that single-site measurements provide a loophole, allowing for finite-time state preparation in certain cases. Here we show how this observation imposes a complexity hierarchy on long-range entangled states based on the minimal number of measurement layers required to create the state, which we call “shots.” First, similar to Abelian stabilizer states, we construct single-shot protocols for creating any non-Abelian quantum double of a group with nilpotency class 2 (such as D4 or Q8). We show that after the measurement, the wave function always collapses into the desired non-Abelian topological order, conditional on recording the measurement outcome. Moreover, the clean quantum double ground state can be deterministically prepared via feedforward—gates that depend on the measurement outcomes. Second, we provide the first constructive proof that a finite number of shots can implement the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation (i.e., the gauging map) for any solvable symmetry group. As a special case, this gives an explicit protocol to prepare twisted quantum doubles for all solvable groups. Third, we argue that certain topological orders, such as nonsolvable quantum doubles or Fibonacci anyons, define nontrivial phases of matter under the equivalence class of finite-depth unitaries and measurement, which cannot be prepared by any finite number of shots. Moreover, we explore the consequences of allowing gates to have exponentially small tails, which enables, for example, the preparation of any Abelian anyon theory, including chiral ones. This hierarchy paints a new picture of the landscape of long-range entangled states, with practical implications for quantum simulators.}},

This model displays two stable phases, characterized by the volume-law and area-law scaling entanglement entropy in steady states. The transition between the two phases is understood from the point of view of quantum error correction: the chaotic unitary evolution protects quantum information from projective measurements that act as errors. A phase transition occurs when the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that depends on the degree of information scrambling. We confirm these results using numerical simulations and obtain the phase diagram of our model. Our work shows that information scrambling plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of entanglement in an open quantum system and relates the entanglement phase transition to changes in quantum channel capacity.}},

In a Floquet spin model, the saturation value after an initial linear growth is identical to the value of a random unitary operator (the Page value). We understand these properties by mapping the operator EE to a global quench problem evolved with a similar parent Hamiltonian in an enlarged Hilbert space with the same chaotic, MBL, and Floquet properties as the original Hamiltonian.

In the Z2-even phase, the usual projection-based scheme can be used to build the Wannier representation. In the Z2-odd phase, we do find a topological obstruction, but only if one insists on choosing a gauge that respects the time-reversal symmetry, corresponding to Wannier functions that come in time-reversal pairs. If, instead, we are willing to violate this gauge condition, a Wannier representation becomes possible. We present an explicit construction of Wannier functions for the Z2-odd phase of the Kane-Mele model via a modified projection scheme, followed by maximal localization, and confirm that these Wannier functions correctly represent the electric polarization and other electronic properties of the insulator.}},

Here, we explore dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use those measurement outcomes to steer the system toward a target state, and we study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates exceed a threshold, yielding an absorbing-state transition in the trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the entanglement transition in individual trajectories and has distinct critical properties. The efficacy of steering depends on the nature of the target state: in particular, for local dynamics targeting long-range correlated states, steering is necessarily slow and the entanglement and steering transitions are well separated in parameter space.}},

The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct advantages; for example, a single data set can be employed multiple times to pursue a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are mapped to a simplified noise model that can more easily be mitigated.

abstract = {{Topological quantum memory can protect information against local errors up to finite error thresholds. Such thresholds are usually determined based on the success of decoding algorithms rather than the intrinsic properties of the mixed states describing corrupted memories. Here we provide an intrinsic characterization of the breakdown of topological quantum memory, which both gives a bound on the performance of decoding algorithms and provides examples of topologically distinct mixed states. We employ three information-theoretical quantities that can be regarded as generalizations of the diagnostics of ground-state topological order, and serve as a definition for topological order in error-corrupted mixed states. We consider the topological contribution to entanglement negativity and two other metrics based on quantum relative entropy and coherent information. In the concrete example of the two-dimensional (2D) Toric code with local bit-flip and phase errors, we map three quantities to observables in 2D classical spin models and analytically show they all undergo a transition at the same error threshold. This threshold is an upper bound on that achieved in any decoding algorithm and is indeed saturated by that in the optimal decoding algorithm for the Toric code.}},

A major hurdle toward experimentally realizing this physics is the need to apply postselection on random measurement outcomes in order to repeatedly prepare a given output state, resulting in an exponential overhead. We propose a method to sidestep this issue in a wide class of nonunitary circuits by taking advantage of spacetime duality. This method maps the purification dynamics of a mixed state under nonunitary evolution onto a particular correlation function in an associated unitary circuit. This translates to an operational protocol which could be straightforwardly implemented on a digital quantum simulator. We discuss the signatures of different entanglement phases, and demonstrate examples via numerical simulations. With minor modifications, the proposed protocol allows measurement of the purity of arbitrary subsystems, which could shed light on the properties of the quantum error correcting code formed by the mixed phase in this class of hybrid dynamics.}},

The Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model of N ≫ 1 Majorana fermions2,3 has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS2, and is a new realization of holography4–6. We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry7,8 through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model9,10. A qubit can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol9.

Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding11–13, coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave14, a Shapiro time delay15, causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics16,17.

The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy S and the Fisher information F, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities S̃(n) and F(n) that depend on the nth moments of density matrices and reduce to S and F in the limit n→1. These quantities with n≥2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with n! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, S̃(n) is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and F(n) is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension q followed by the replica limit n→1, we obtain the critical measurement probability pc=1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.}},

This includes operators spreading under Heisenberg time evolution, which we find are much less entangled than "typical" operators of the same spatial support. Extending previous conjectures based on random circuit dynamics, we provide evidence that the leading-order entanglement dynamics of a given chaotic system are determined by a function \$\textbackslashmathcal\{E\}(v)\$, which is model-dependent, but which we argue satisfies certain general constraints. In a minimal membrane picture, \$\textbackslashmathcal\{E\}(v)\$ is the "surface tension" of the membrane and is a function of the membrane's orientation \$v\$ in spacetime. For one-dimensional (1D) systems this surface tension is related by a Legendre transformation to an entanglement entropy growth rate \$\textbackslashGamma(\textbackslashpartial S/\textbackslashpartial x)\$ which depends on the spatial "gradient" of the entanglement entropy \$S(x,t)\$ across the cut at position \$x\$. We show how to extract the entanglement growth functions numerically in 1D at infinite temperature using the concept of the operator entanglement of the time evolution operator, and we discuss possible universality of \$\textbackslashmathcal\{E\}\$ at low temperatures. Our theoretical ideas are tested against and informed by numerical results for a quantum-chaotic 1D spin Hamiltonian.

abstract = {{Interacting many-body systems with explicitly accessible spatio-temporal correlation functions are extremely rare, especially in the absence of integrability. Recently, we identified a remarkable class of such systems and termed them dual-unitary quantum circuits. These are brick-wall type local quantum circuits whose dynamics are unitary in both time and space. For these systems the spatio-temporal correlation functions are non-trivial only at the edge of the causal light cone and can be computed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. Dual-unitarity, however, requires fine-tuning and the degree of generality of the observed dynamical features remained unclear. Here we address this question by introducing arbitrary perturbations of the local gates. Considering fixed perturbations, we prove that for a particular class of unperturbed elementary dual-unitary gates the correlation functions are still expressed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. These matrices, however, are now contracted over generic paths connecting the origin to a fixed endpoint inside the causal light cone. The correlation function is given as a sum over all such paths. Our statement is rigorous in the "dilute limit", where only a small fraction of the gates is perturbed, and in the presence of random longitudinal fields, but we provide theoretical arguments and stringent numerical checks supporting its validity even in the clean case and when all gates are perturbed. As a byproduct, in the case of random longitudinal fields -- which turns out to be equivalent to certain classical Markov chains -- we find four types of non-dual-unitary(and non-integrable) interacting many-body systems where the correlation functions are exactly given by the path-sum formula.}},

This concept accompanies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum systems, and has recently emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing chaos in black holes1–4. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process5,6. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit, providing an unambiguous test for whether scrambling has occurred, while simultaneously measuring an OTOC. We engineer quantum scrambling processes through a tunable three-qubit unitary operation as part of a seven-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities are typically about 80 per cent, and enable us to experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.

The integrability-breaking perturbation introduces hopping in this Fock space, and chaos sets in when this hopping delocalizes the many-body eigenstates in this space. Depending on the range of the dominant Fock-space hopping, delocalization can occur either through a crossover, or via a transition that becomes sharp in the appropriate large-system dynamic limit. In either case, the perturbation strength at the onset of chaos scales to zero in the usual thermodynamic limit, with a size-dependence that we estimate analytically and compute numerically for a few specific models. We also identify two intermediate finite-size-dependent regimes: There is generally an intermediate nonchaotic regime in which integrability is broken strongly enough to produce some system-wide many-body resonances but not enough to thermalize the system. In spatially extended systems (but not in quantum dots) there is also a crossover or transition between chaotic regimes where the ratio of the system size to the mean free path of the quasiparticles of the integrable system is small versus large compared to unity.}},

Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement structure of the resulting long-time states, in part due to the fundamental difficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons. We investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two “toy” models for coherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model, and a class of random quantum circuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive, interacting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be tuned to have no interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson model. We show that the long-time states of driven noninteracting fermions exhibit volume-law mutual information and entanglement, both for our random circuit model and for the nonequilibrium steady state of the Anderson model. With interactions, the random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches local equilibrium, with only short-range entanglement. These results provide a generic picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven, quantum-chaotic systems, and also provide examples of stable, highly entangled, many-body states out of equilibrium. We discuss experimental techniques to probe these effects in low-temperature mesoscopic wires or ultracold atomic gases.}},

abstract = {{We study fermionic topological phases using the technique of fermion condensation. We give a prescription for performing fermion condensation in bosonic topological phases that contain a fermion. Our approach to fermion condensation can roughly be understood as coupling the parent bosonic topological phase to a phase of physical fermions and condensing pairs of physical and emergent fermions. There are two distinct types of objects in the resulting fermionic fusion categories, which we call “m-type” and “q-type” objects. The endomorphism algebras of q-type objects are complex Clifford algebras, and they have no analogs in bosonic theories. We construct a fermionic generalization of the tube category, which allows us to compute the quasiparticle excitations arising from the condensed theories. We prove a series of results relating data in fermionic theories to data in their parent bosonic theories; for example, if C is a modular tensor category containing a fermion, then the tube category constructed from the condensed theory satisfies T u b e ( C / ψ ) ≅ C × ( C / ψ ) . We also study how modular transformations, fusion rules, and coherence relations are modified in the fermionic setting, prove a fermionic version of the Verlinde dimension formula, construct a commuting projector lattice Hamiltonian for fermionic theories, and write down a fermionic version of the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury state sum. A large portion of this work is devoted to three detailed examples of performing fermion condensation to produce fermionic topological phases: we condense fermions in the Ising theory, the SO(3)6 theory, and the 1 2 E 6 theory and compute the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in each of the condensed theories.}},

To address this issue, we perform combined temperature-dependent transport measurements of both the longitudinal and Hall resistivities in near-magic-angle TBG. While the observed longitudinal resistivity follows linear temperature T dependence consistent with previous reports, the Hall resistance shows an anomalous T dependence with the cotangent of the Hall angle cotΘH∝T2. Boltzmann theory for quasiparticle transport predicts that both the resistivity and cotΘH should have the same T dependence, contradicting the observed behavior.

We present some paradigmatic examples that show how this architecture might be used to describe the physics of condensed matter and high-energy physics systems.

A major hurdle toward experimentally realizing this physics is the need to apply postselection on random measurement outcomes in order to repeatedly prepare a given output state, resulting in an exponential overhead. We propose a method to sidestep this issue in a wide class of nonunitary circuits by taking advantage of spacetime duality. This method maps the purification dynamics of a mixed state under nonunitary evolution onto a particular correlation function in an associated unitary circuit. This translates to an operational protocol which could be straightforwardly implemented on a digital quantum simulator. We discuss the signatures of different entanglement phases, and demonstrate examples via numerical simulations. With minor modifications, the proposed protocol allows measurement of the purity of arbitrary subsystems, which could shed light on the properties of the quantum error correcting code formed by the mixed phase in this class of hybrid dynamics.}},

abstract = {{We demonstrate that linear combinations of subregion entropies with canceling boundary terms, commonly used to calculate the topological entanglement entropy, may suffer from spurious nontopological contributions even in models with zero correlation length. These spurious contributions are due to a specific kind of long-range string order and persist throughout certain subsystem symmetry-protected phases. We introduce an entropic quantity that measures the presence of such order, and hence should serve as an order parameter for the aforementioned phases.}},

abstract = {{Quantum process tomography is a powerful tool for understanding quantum channels and characterizing properties of quantum devices. Inspired by recent advances using classical shadows in quantum state tomography[1], we have developed ShadowQPT, a classical shadow method for quantum process tomography. We introduce two related formulations with and without ancilla qubits. ShadowQPT stochastically reconstructs the Choi matrix of the device allowing for an a-posteri classical evaluation of the device on arbitrary inputs with respect to arbitrary outputs. Using shadows we then show how to compute overlaps, generate all \$k\$-weight reduced processes, and perform reconstruction via Hamiltonian learning. These latter two tasks are efficient for large systems as the number of quantum measurements needed scales only logarithmically with the number of qubits. A number of additional approximations and improvements are developed including the use of a pair-factorized Clifford shadow and a series of post-processing techniques which significantly enhance the accuracy for recovering the quantum channel. We have implemented ShadowQPT using both Pauli and Clifford measurements on the IonQ trapped ion quantum computer for quantum processes up to \$n=4\$ qubits and achieved good performance.}},

The phase of the Hamiltonian is identified by examining which MPS descriptions, if any, are injective, namely, whether the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix obtained from the MPS is unique.

Using a parton construction, such measurements map to random Gaussian tensor networks, and in particular, random Pauli measurements map to a classical loop model in which watermelon correlators precisely determine measurement-induced entanglement. Measuring all but a 1d boundary of qubits realizes hybrid circuits involving unitary gates and projective measurements in 1+1 dimensions. We find that varying the probabilities of different Pauli measurements can drive transitions in the unmeasured boundary between phases with different orders and entanglement scaling, corresponding to short- and long-loop phases in the classical model. Furthermore, by utilizing single-site boundary unitaries conditioned on the bulk measurement outcomes, we generate mixed-state ordered phases and transitions that can be experimentally diagnosed via linear observables. This demonstrates how parton constructions provide a natural framework for measurement-based quantum computing setups to produce and manipulate phases of matter.}},

This approximation allows the application of powerful analytical and numerical techniques, and has provided a powerful tool for the study of both the strong and the electroweak interaction. After introductory chapters on scalar fields, gauge fields and fermion fields, the book studies quarks and gluons in QCD and fermions and bosons in the electroweak theory. The last chapter is devoted to numerical simulation algorithms which have been used in recent large-scale numerical simulations. The book will be valuable for graduate students and researchers in theoretical physics, elementary particle physics, and field theory, interested in non-perturbative approximations and numerical simulations of quantum field phenomena.}},

They do not only serve as variational states in numerical simulation methods, but also provide a framework for classifying phases of quantum matter and capture notions of topological order in a stringent and rigorous language. The rapid development in this field for spin models and bosonic systems has not yet been mirrored by an analogous development for fermionic models. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism capable of capturing notions of topological order for quantum systems with fermionic components. At the heart of the formalism are axioms of fermionic matrix-product operator injectivity, stable under concatenation. Building upon that, we formulate a Grassmann number tensor network ansatz for the ground state of fermionic twisted quantum double models. A specific focus is put on the paradigmatic example of the fermionic toric code. This work shows that the program of describing topologically ordered systems using tensor networks carries over to fermionic models.}},

We then construct a compatible gauging map for operators, which preserves locality and reproduces the minimal coupling scheme for simple operators. By combining this construction with the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), we can show that an injective PEPS for the matter fields is gauged into a G-injective PEPS for the combined gauge-matter system, which potentially has topological order. We derive the corresponding parent Hamiltonian, which is a frustration-free gauge-theory Hamiltonian closely related to the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian at zero coupling constant. We can then introduce gauge dynamics at finite values of the coupling constant by applying a local filtering operation. This scheme results in a low-parameter family of gauge-invariant states of which we can accurately probe the phase diagram, as we illustrate by studying a Z2 gauge theory with Higgs matter.}},
