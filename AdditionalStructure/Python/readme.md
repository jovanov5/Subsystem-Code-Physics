# README

This folder contains the necessary `.py` dependency files for the project.

They are to used in `.py` and `.ipynb` files in the project that are working with the `Python` language.

They are made to resemble the `Julia` dependencies in function (ToDo: Python is OOP, so classes may be useful).

Reasons to include Python versions of the dependancies is to interface with SageMaths programs.
